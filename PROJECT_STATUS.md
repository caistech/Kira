## Current State
<!-- One of: ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT | MAINTENANCE | BLOCKED | PAUSED | SHIPPED -->
**Status**: ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT

## What Was Just Done
<!-- Updated at end of each session. Most recent first. -->
- `eb52352` — org_type selector on admin create-org form + latent portals bug fix.
  `portals.portal_level DEFAULT 'business'` violated its own CHECK (portfolio/project/
  distributor/client_org); every portals writer now sets `portal_level` + `journey_type`
  explicitly; migration `20260921130000` drops both defaults.
- `d5ddba0` — fixed 29 pre-existing test failures across 10 files (full suite: 1984 passed /
  0 failed). Relocated the `/plan` first-paint guard to `/business-valuation` (money-answer
  moved homes when `/plan` became the beta/identity gate).
- (earlier this month) Lane-aware /talk provisioning (`?journey=`), consultant-genome
  extraction seam from /talk interviews, portal-lane autobootstrap, chain-of-truth hierarchy.

## What's Next
<!-- Prioritised list of pending work. Updated each session. -->
- [ ] Tighten the consultant/distributor extraction prompt
      (`lib/kira/consultant-genome-extract.ts` `EXTRACTION_PROMPT`) so a distributor interview
      is not forced into a "consultant-with-methodology" shape.
- [ ] `app/api/kira/webhooks/research_practice/route.ts` — stale untracked stub from another
      session; imports renamed `researchPractice` export and breaks `tsc`. Decide: delete or
      point at new `researchOrganisation` (lib/kira/practice-intelligence/research.ts).

## Blockers
<!-- Anything preventing progress. Include who/what is needed to unblock. -->
- (none) — migration `20260921130000` applied to live Supabase 2026-09-21 (defaults dropped,
  verified NULL). No known blockers.

## Key Decisions Made
<!-- Important architectural or product decisions, with rationale. -->
- `/plan` is now a beta-redemption + identity gate; the money-answer lives on
  `/business-valuation` (uses `priceForProfit`/`FULL_RATE_PERIOD_CAP` from charging constants).
- Dashboard never redirects an empty account to `/start` — it renders the outstanding
  onboarding step in place (`nextOnboardingStep`/`OnboardingGate`); `/talk?welcome=1` marks a
  just-arrived paid owner; beta converges through `/auth/callback → /plan?code=`.
- `portals.portal_level`/`journey_type` have NO valid DB default — every writer supplies them
  explicitly so an omission fails loudly (NOT NULL) rather than silently (CHECK).
- Admin-created org mints the invite journey by org_type: `client_org` → business lane, other
  lanes → consultant lane.

## Active Branches
<!-- Git branches with in-progress work. -->

## Environment Notes
<!-- Deployment URLs, env vars needed, external service dependencies. -->
